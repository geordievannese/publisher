## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1
1) In the Observer pattern diagram explained by the Head First Design Pattern book, Subscriber is defined as an interface. Explain based on your understanding of Observer design patterns, do we still need an interface (or trait in Rust) in this BambangShop case, or a single Model struct is enough?

In the Observer pattern, a Subscriber is typically a trait that defines how updates are received. In BambangShop, however, the Subscriber is just a struct that holds data without any special behavior. Since all subscribers behave the same way, there's no need for a trait at the moment. You'd only need a trait if different types of subscribers had different behaviors. So for now, using a simple struct is sufficient.

2) id in Program and url in Subscriber is intended to be unique. Explain based on your understanding, is using Vec (list) sufficient or using DashMap (map/dictionary) like we currently use is necessary for this case?

While it's possible to use a Vec to store unique items like IDs or URLs, it's not very efficient. You'd have to manually check for duplicates and search through the list, which becomes slower as the list grows. DashMap, on the other hand, offers fast access, ensures uniqueness by key automatically, and makes deletion easy. In this case, DashMap is a better and more suitable choice.

3) When programming using Rust, we are enforced by rigorous compiler constraints to make a thread-safe program. In the case of the List of Subscribers (SUBSCRIBERS) static variable, we used the DashMap external library for thread safe HashMap. Explain based on your understanding of design patterns, do we still need DashMap or we can implement Singleton pattern instead?

The Singleton pattern gives you a single, global instance but doesnt make data thread-safe. In Rust, thread safety is important, especially when multiple threads access shared data like SUBSCRIBERS. DashMap is a thread-safe map that allows safe concurrent access without manual locking. Even with a Singleton, you would still need DashMap or another thread-safe structure. So, using DashMap is still necessary in this case.
#### Reflection Publisher-2
1) In the Model-View Controller (MVC) compound pattern, there is no “Service” and “Repository”. Model in MVC covers both data storage and business logic. Explain based on your understanding of design principles, why we need to separate “Service” and “Repository” from a Model?

Separating Service and Repository from Model helps keep the codebase clean and well-organized. Each layer has a clear responsibility: models store data, services contain business logic, and repositories handle database interactions. This separation makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain. It also makes it easier to scale the project without things getting messy.

2) What happens if we only use the Model? Explain your imagination on how the interactions between each model (Program, Subscriber, Notification) affect the code complexity for each model?

If we rely only on the Model, each model ends up doing everything—managing data, handling logic, and accessing the database. This leads to messy, tightly coupled code that's harder to understand and maintain. Small changes in one model could easily break others. By separating responsibilities into services and repositories, we keep the code cleaner, more modular, and much easier to manage.

3) Have you explored more about Postman? Tell us how this tool helps you to test your current work. You might want to also list which features in Postman you are interested in or feel like it is helpful to help your Group Project or any of your future software engineering projects.

Yes, I’ve used Postman to test my API endpoints—it’s a great way to quickly verify if everything works as expected. It’s a handy tool for both solo and team projects, especially when working with APIs.
